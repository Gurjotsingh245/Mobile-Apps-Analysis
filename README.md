Analysis of Apple Store Apps

### Project Overview
This data analysis projects aims to provide insights into the Apple app store. By analyzing various aspects of apps, I seek to identify trends and make data driven recommendations. 

### Data Source
I used a data source that was split in 2 files, AppleStore.csv and appleStore_description.csv. Both of these files contains 1 tables each. 

### Findings
Paid apps have higher ratings than free apps. Customers could precieve paid apps as having more value, thus resulting in them giving paid apps a higher rating. Paid apps might generate higher revenues, leading to developers allocating more recources to them. My recommendation is if a developer feels that their app is high quality, to charge a good price. 

Customers rated apps that charge between $2 and $4 the highest, at an average rating of 3.86. Hence, developers should strongly consider this price point, as customers perceive it as high value for its money. 

Catalog, finance, and book apps have the lowest ratings on average in the Apple app store. Hence, developers could focus on grabbing market share on these genres where competition is low.

Apps that support a moderate number of languages (10 - 30) tend to have the highest user ratings. Hence, developers dont need to waste money on supporting an excessively large amount of apps. Instead, ensure that all the popular languages are supported.

When I compared app size to user ratings, I found that large app and medium app sizes fared the best, at an average rating of 3.77 and 3.74. Hence, developers should ensure their app size are sufficient enough for all the latest features and options for best ratings. 

Apps with longer descriptions have better user ratings. Customers tend to have a better understanding of the app with longer descriptions, leading to a more informed customer before purchase. This leads to higher customer satisfaction and ratings.

Games and Entertainment genres have highest number of apps, thus immense competition. However, the high number of apps is a reflection of the great demand for these genres. Developers should also seek to enter these genres.
